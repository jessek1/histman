**HistMan - Take Control of Your Browser History**

HistMan automatically removes browser history entries that match your configured domains and keywords. Whether you're protecting your privacy, keeping your history clean, or simply want certain sites to never appear in your browsing history, HistMan makes it effortless.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**KEY FEATURES**

◆ Domain Filtering
Add any domain to your block list and HistMan will automatically delete all history entries from that site. Subdomains are included automatically - blocking "example.com" also blocks "www.example.com", "mail.example.com", and any other subdomain.

◆ Keyword Filtering
Block history entries containing specific keywords anywhere in the URL. Perfect for filtering out specific pages, search queries, or URL patterns you don't want in your history.

◆ Real-Time Protection
HistMan works silently in the background. As soon as you visit a matching page, it's removed from your history before you even close the tab. No manual intervention needed.

◆ Scan & Clean Existing History
Already have history entries you want to remove? Use the "Scan & Clean History" button to search through your existing browsing history and delete all entries matching your configured domains and keywords.

◆ Simple Toggle Control
Quickly enable or disable HistMan with a single click. Your domain and keyword lists are preserved, so you can turn protection back on anytime.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**SECURITY FEATURES**

◆ Password Protection (Optional)
Don't want others to see or modify your block lists? Set a password to lock HistMan. Your settings will be hidden behind a secure login screen.

◆ Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)
For maximum security, enable 2FA using any TOTP-compatible authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, or 1Password. Scan the QR code or enter the secret key manually.

◆ Secure Password Storage
Your password is never stored in plain text. HistMan uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and a random salt to securely hash your password.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**PRIVACY FOCUSED**

◆ 100% Local Operation
HistMan operates entirely on your device. Your domains, keywords, passwords, and browsing data are NEVER sent to any external server.

◆ No Analytics or Tracking
We don't collect any usage data, analytics, or telemetry. What you do with HistMan stays on your device.

◆ No Account Required
HistMan works out of the box. No sign-up, no email, no account creation. Install and start using immediately.

◆ Open & Transparent
We request only the minimum permissions needed:
• "history" - to read and delete matching history entries
• "storage" - to save your settings locally

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**HOW TO USE**

1. Click the HistMan icon in your browser toolbar
2. Add domains you want to block (e.g., "example.com")
3. Add keywords you want to filter (e.g., "private")
4. That's it! HistMan will automatically delete matching history entries

Optional: Click the gear icon to set up password protection and 2FA for additional security.
